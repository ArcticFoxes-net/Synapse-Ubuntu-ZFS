# Whether guests should be allowed to use the TURN server.
# This defaults to True, otherwise VoIP will be unreliable for guests.
# However, it does introduce a slight security risk as it allows users to
# connect to arbitrary endpoints without having first signed up for a
# valid account (e.g. by passing a CAPTCHA).
